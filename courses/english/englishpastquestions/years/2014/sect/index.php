    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-4 themed-grid-col">.col-4</div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three equal-width columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>. On mobile devices, tablets and below, the columns will automatically stack.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-4 themed-grid-col">.col-md-4</div>

      <div class="col-md-4 themed-grid-col">.col-md-4</div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>
    <div class="row row-cols-md-3 mb-3">
      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>
      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>
      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-3 themed-grid-col">.col-md-3</div>
      <div class="col-md-6 themed-grid-col">.col-md-6</div>
      <div class="col-md-3 themed-grid-col">.col-md-3</div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns</h2>
    <p>Get two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col">.col-md-8</div>
      <div class="col-md-4 themed-grid-col">.col-md-4</div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Full width, single column</h2>
    <p class="text-warning">
      No grid classes are necessary for full-width elements.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-4">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col">
        <div class="pb-3">
          .col-md-8

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mixed: mobile and desktop</h2>
    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

          [30 marks]<br /><br />
          <p>4. Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow<br /><br />

            Fatimeh was always silent. She learnt a lot within a short time. In one month, she could milk cows, separate butter and cheese from the milk, ferment the milk and cook nearly as well as Rikku’s mother. At first, she went with Rikku’s mother to hawk the sour milk; she was beginning to find her way to and from town.<br />
            Fatimeh was always chewing tobacco flower and so her lips, teeth and gums became red. Hodio noticed that her looks had improved since she came to live with the family. Her skin was smooth and shiny; she had also put on more flesh.<br />
            Towards nightfall, when Fatimeh came home, she would take a pot and go down to the stream where she bathed and drew water. Sometimes, she went with Leibe or Shaitu; she was never alone.<br />
            One evening, Hodio followed Fatimeh quietly to the stream when the place was quiet and he could hear the sound of his own footsteps on the dusty road. When he caught up with Fatimeh, he suggested to her to run away with him because he loved her dearly and wanted her to be his wife. Fatimeh refused. She knew very well that, as a slave, she could never hope to marry a freeborn and proud Fulani like Hodio Sunsaye.<br />
            Hodio did not give up. He spoke to her again. He tried to persuade her to run away with him and live in a town where no one cared about tradition and custom. Eventually, Fatimeh agreed to consider his proposal.<br />
            Hodio’s father, old Sunsaye, was the first person who missed Fatimeh. He called his wife, Shaitu, and asked her if she had seen Fatimeh. She replied in the negative. He asked Rikku and Leibe. No one could tell him where Hodio and Fatimeh were. They then looked behind the hut; the horse was not there.<br /><br /><br />

            (a) What two things did the girl learn to do in one month?<br /><br />

            (b) Give two adjectives that describe Fatimeh as presented in the first paragraph.<br /><br />

            (c) What was Hodio’s main reason for following Fatimeh to the stream?<br /><br />

            (d) Fatimeh refused.<br />
            (i) What did Fatimeh refuse to do at first?<br /><br />
            (ii) Why did she refuse Hodio’s proposal?<br /><br />

            (e) Why did Hodio want to live in a town?<br /><br />

            (f) For each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same and can fit into the passage:<br />
            (i) silent<br /><br />
            (ii) sour,<br /><br />
