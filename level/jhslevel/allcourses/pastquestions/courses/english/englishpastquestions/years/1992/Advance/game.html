We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

They joked with Njoman, for they knew why he was there. Soon they saw Ragini approaching with a basket of fruits and vegetables on her head.\nHello, Njoman,\u2019 she said, pretending not to know why he waited there with his best friend. Hello Ragini. What did you buy in the market?\u2019 Mostly fruits for rudjaks\u2019 (spicy salad). Wait, Ragini\u2019, Njoman said as he stood up. Putu will carry them for you. It is time for us to go off together and marry\u2019. Putu took the basket; Njoman took Ragini by the hand and said, We shall go to my cousin\u2019s house in the next village\u2019.\nAs they were walking off, Ragini turned to the women and feigned distress. Njoman is taking me away. What can I do?\u2019 In this way, according to Balinese tradition, Ragini submitted to her abductor.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nApart from foods which supply us with energy, we need certain substances called protein to help us grow, and when we are fully grown, to maintain our strength. These proteins are found in meat, fish, eggs, milk, green vegetables and to a much lesser extent in grains like millet, wheat, guinea corn, rice, etc.\nChildren fed chiefly on roots will, therefore, stop growing. They often get very ill and die while children who are given milk and eggs grow well and live longer.\nHowever, cow milk is expensive in West Africa and in many places there is a wrong tradition about eggs. Some old people say that if eggs are given to children they become liars. This is not true. Eggs do not make children either tell truth or lie. They are simply good food which will help the child to grow well.\n Also, the tradition that boys become thieves when they eat meat is not true. Both are bad traditions which have been repeated in some villages from one generation to another. So, the intelligent mother who wishes to bring up healthy children must discard them.")
