<u>Suggested Answer</u><br /><br />

1. (a) (i) Temperature = 100&deg;C or 212&deg;F or 373K<br /><br />

(ii) Observations (Nails)

Nails 1, 2, 3 and 4 will drop off one after the other
- Nail 1 drops first, nail 2 second, nail 3 third and nail 4 fourth<br /><br />

(iii) Observations(Thermometers)
The readings of Thermometers A,B, C and D will increase progressively till they reach 100&deg; C
-Thermometer A reaches 100&deg; C first, B second,C third and D fourth<br /><br />

(iv) Mode of heat transfer - Conduction<br /><br/>

(v) Effects of heat<br />

1. Causes increase in temperature(as shown by the thermometer readings)<br />

2. Causes change in state (candle wax melts - changes from solid to liquid)<br /><br />

(vi) Aim of experiment<br />

1. To show that metals are good conductors of heat<br/ >

2. To show that heat travels through metals
