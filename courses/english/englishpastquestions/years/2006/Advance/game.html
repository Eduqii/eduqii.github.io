We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

However, Amma had decided she wasn‟t going to work that day.\n“What do I do to escape these chores?” Amma asked.“I‟ll pretend to be ill, then Mama can‟t insist that I do any work. This is a brilliant idea. I‟m not so daft after all,” she thought.When Amma told Maa Tee about her headache, MaaTee suspended everything she was doing and ordered her to get ready for the hospital.\n Poor Amma, her plan had backfired! On their way to the hospital Amma prayed that the doctor would be absent, but she was out of luck that day. The doctor examined Amma and found her as fit as a fiddle. He then guessed that Amma had feigned illness because she wanted to dodge her usual Saturday morning chores.“I‟m sorry MaaTee, Amma is very ill. Take her to the injection room for three injections. They will …”Before the doctor could finish speaking, Amma rushed out of the consulting room with lightening speed and would not stop anywhere till she reached home.\n The doctor then looked at Maa Tee and burst out laughing as he asked MaaTee to go home. By the time MaaTee got home Amma had finished all the household chores.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nGrandpa is a robust centenarian. At his age, his eyesight is as clear as a child‟s and his memory as equally sharp. We have always wondered what has kept him going all these years. “I have a secret theory of life,” is the reply he gives to anyone who asks.Grandpa‟s secret theory is, after all, quite simple when he explains it. He talks of a joyful attitude to life.\n He says that joy begets enthusiasm and a burning desire to encourage others. He never walks anyone away who needs help, even though Grandpa can never be described as rich.Grandpa believes that as we see ourselves in a mirror, so do others see us.\n The mirror merely reflects what is before it. So if we are wicked, people will see us as wicked and if we are honest, we will not suspect others of being deceitful.One part of Grandpa‟s secret theory that he holds dearest is his love for truth. He thinks that truth enables one to live a free life devoid of stress and worries. “Let your nay be nay,” he says, whenever he finds one of us telling a lie in order to avoid trouble. He believes that if we tell lies, we will have to create more lies to cover them. On the other hand truth never changes.Grandpa never ends his explanation without rolling his eyes excitedly and advising us to be true toourselves so that we can‟t be false to others.")
