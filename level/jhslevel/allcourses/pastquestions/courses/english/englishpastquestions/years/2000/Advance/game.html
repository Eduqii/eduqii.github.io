We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

		alert("PASSAGE I\n\nMr. Kobi, the next speaker, said that although he had left the school many years ago, he still remembered with thanks all that the headmaster had done to make sure that his pupils were well prepared for life. He was sorry that the headmaster had decided to retire at so early an age. This would deprive the pupils of his assistance long before it was necessary to do so. However, he wished the headmaster the best of luck in his retirement and offered him a silver tray as a sign of the high esteem in which his old pupils held him.\nAfter the tray had been handed over, the retiring headmaster came forward to make his speech of thanks. He began by giving a brief summary of the time he had spent as headmaster of the school. He added that it had always been his aim to do his best for the pupils under his charge. He expressed his gratitude to the masters who had been on his staff for their hard work and sacrifice. Finally, he said how glad he was that he was being succeeded as headmaster by Mr. Smith, who had been teaching in the school for many years. He believed that Mr. Smith was generally admired and respected by all who knew him. He asked all his old pupils to take an interest in the school after he had gone, and promised that he would certainly do so himself.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nIt is easy to see why television is so attractive to both children and adults. It is available in the home and we can watch it in comfort whenever we please. Besides, it provides entertainment after a day\u2019s work. Television also enables us to see places and people and their ways of life. Even people with little or no formal education can watch and enjoy the programmes.\nUnfortunately, television takes up much of our time. To watch it we must sit in front of it, watch as long as a programme lasts, and do little else. This exclusive aspect of television, the fact that it prevents us from doing other things, poses more serious problems than is commonly realized. While television may provide an acceptable form of relaxation for adults after a day\u2019s work, it robs children of the time they must use to learn other things. In addition, not everything that television offers is good. Even when children\u2019s programmes are provided, we are not sure that these are the only ones they will watch. In fact, these days children watch more programmes meant for adults than for them.\nOne likely outcome of this is that children may learn about the adult world too soon, and at a time when they can easily be influenced.")
