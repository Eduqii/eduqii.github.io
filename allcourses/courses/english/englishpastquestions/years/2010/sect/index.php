    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three equal-width columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>. On mobile devices, tablets and below, the columns will automatically stack.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>
    <div class="row row-cols-md-3 mb-3">
      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>

      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-3 themed-grid-col">.col-md-3</div>
      <div class="col-md-6 themed-grid-col">.col-md-6</div>
      <div class="col-md-3 themed-grid-col">.col-md-3</div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns</h2>
    <p>Get two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Full width, single column</h2>
    <p class="text-warning">
      No grid classes are necessary for full-width elements.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-4">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mixed: mobile and desktop</h2>
    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

          [30 marks]<br /><br />
          <p>4. Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow<br /><br />

            When I was about eleven years old, I was unable to stay at one place for long; I was always on the move.<br />
            Many people thought and said I was troublesome. Prominent among those who described me as such was my aunt, Araba Oboshea.<br />
            Aunt Araba was particularly mean. She would sit on her stool under the gum tree in front of the house and wait for me to return from wherever I had gone. As soon as I arrived she would call me and, without asking me any question or telling me anything, take my left ear between the forefinger and the thumb of her right hand and give my ear a silent, violent and painful twist. I cannot describe the pain I endured. She would do the same to my right ear. <br />
            She explained that she was paying for my absence that I had sold to her! Aunt Araba would continue to twist both ears of mine simultaneously with her forefingers and thumbs. I would scream silently, gritting my teeth so that I could not utter any sound because of pain. That way I was spared the next stage of being given countless strokes of any stick she could lay hands on. One strange thing about Aunt Araba was that she would never hit me with her hands.<br />
            Aunt Araba went on treating me this way because she could hardly understand why I was always on the move. I could also not have the courage to explain why it was so because I was afraid of her and began to hate her. <br />
            One Thursday evening when I was going through my usual ordeal, an elderly man, Agya Manu who usually visited her appeared on the scene. He pleaded with her to leave me, and asked for the reason for such punishment. <br />
            After he had been told of my “sin”, Agya Manu, who knew me very well, explained to my auntie that I was always on the move not because I was in any bad company, but because I was favourite for any errand. I had been running several errands for him
            and many other people. Agya Manu then advised me not to spend all my time running errands for others but rather, do all my duties at home.<br /><br />

            a) What was the writer’s behaviour when he was about eleven years old?<br /><br /><br />

            b) … I was always on the move.<br />
            What is the meaning of this expression?<br /><br /><br />

            c) From the passage, what is the character of Aunt Araba?<br /><br /><br />

            d) Why did Aunt Araba keep punishing the writer<br /><br /><br />

            e) How did Agya Manu rescue the writer<br /><br /><br />

            f) For each of the following words, give one word or phrase which means the same:<br />

            (i) endured<br /><br />
            (ii) countless

                or<br />
