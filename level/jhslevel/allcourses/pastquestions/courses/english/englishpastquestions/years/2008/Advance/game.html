We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

		alert("PASSAGE I\n Since the building of the District Hospital at Kpota, there had sprung up some residential structures around the hospital. One particular cluster of houses took the fancy of Mr. Akpaloo, who told himself that if ever he wanted to build a house, it would be like one of those.When Mr Akpaloo thought he was ready to put up his own building, one of the things he did was to look for the plan of the house that he so admired.\n He went to the office of Dr. Agbetor, the Hospital Administrator to ask for it. Dr. Agbetor explained that those houses in which Mr. Akpaloo was interested had actually been built by Dr. Grant who still had the blueprint of the structure. \nObviously, the person to see was Dr. Grant.Mr. Akpaloo went and saw Dr. Grant in his magnificent house at Tokoe. The latter explained that it was not prudent to give out the plan that had been specifically designed for those projects. However, he advised Mr. Akpaloo to go to the site and see the caretaker who would show him the rooms. Mr Akpaloo could then make a sketch of the building. To the site Mr. Akpaloo went. When he arrived, the caretaker took him round. What had looked like a two- bedroom house from afar, was at close quarters, a four-bedroom affair. The difference that distance can make! ");

    alert("PASSAGE II\nOne day a poor fishermen went fishing and caught nothing. He was just about to go home when he felt the net suddenly grow heavy. He thought he had caught a large fish. But when he dragged it ashore, he found only a heavy copper pot sealed with lead. He took it and feeling sure it contained something valuable, he took his knife, cut the lead top and turned it upside down. For a moment nothing came out; and then it started to smoke, and this smoke slowly rose right up to the sky like a thick fog. It suddenly turned into a huge genie.Bow down\u2019 said the genie and let me kill you\u2019.\n Why?\u2019 asked the fisherman. Have you forgotten that I set you free?\u2019Yes, but I have sworn to kill you\u2019, said the genie. I\u2019m a spirit that rebelled against the Creator, and to punish me he shut me up in this copper pot. During the first century of my captivity, I swore to make anyone who freed me rich. During my second century, I swore I would grant him any three things. But after these centuries, in anger I swore to kill my liberator without mercy\u2019.Well, die I must\u2019, said the fisherman, but swear that you really were in that pot. It is too small to hold even your little finger. Unless I see it, I shall not believe it.See then and believe\u2019 said the genie.He slowly changed back into smoke and entered the pot. The fishermen immediately put back the lead cover and threw it into the sea.")
