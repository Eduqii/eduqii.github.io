                (a) Explain how <br />
(i) lithium atom becomes positively charged <br />
Lithium has 1 electron in its outermost shell, making it unstable. In order to become stable, it loses the electron on its outermost shell. As a result, the atom becomes positively charged, since there is now 1 more positive charge (proton) than negative charge (electron) <br/ ><br />

(ii) oxygen atom becomes negatively charged <br />
Oxygen has 6 electrons in its outermost shell, making it unstable. In order to become stable, it gains 2 more electrons on its outermost shell to make it completely filled. As a result, the negative charges (electrons) become 2 more than the positive charges (protons), making the atom negatively charged. <br /><br />

(b) (i) What is potential energy? <br />
The energy possessed by a body as a result of its position or state. <br /><br />

(ii) A coconut of mass 2 kg is on a tree 5 m tall. Determine the potential energy of the coconut at this height [Take g = 10 ms–2] <br /><br />

Potential energy = mass(m) × height(h) × acceleration due to gravity(g) <br />
= 2 kg × 5 m × 10ms-2 <br />
= 100kgm2s-2 <br />
= 100 J <br /><br />

(i) Indiscriminate / Casual sex <br />
(ii) Irresponsible parenting <br />
