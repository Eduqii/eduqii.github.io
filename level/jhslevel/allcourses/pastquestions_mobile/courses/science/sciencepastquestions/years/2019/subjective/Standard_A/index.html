  the test tube image.
  After three days the nail in test tube A was found to have rusted while the nail in test tubes B and C did not rust.

    (i)Suggest and aim for the experiment.
    (ii) Why was the water in test tube B boiled?
    (iii) State the function of the oil on top of the water in test tube B.
    (iv) What is the purpose of the calcium chloride in test tube C?
