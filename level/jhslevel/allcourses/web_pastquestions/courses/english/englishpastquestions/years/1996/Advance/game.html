We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

Of late he has observed that giggling and murmuring have reared their ugly heads in the class. This time he was determined to find the cause of this naughty behaviour and discipline the culprits.\nPretending not to have heard the noise, he moved to the blackboard as if to write something on it but in reality to set a trap. Immediately the giggling and murmuring resumed, he turned and spotted three big boys at the back of the class chattering. His turning was so quick that he caught them right in the act. He also saw one of the boys passing on a magazine to the boy next to him.\nWith the speed of lightning, Mr Mensah got there, asked the three boys to stand up and then searched them in order to seize the magazine. Smart though he was, the boys were even smarter, for the boy sitting next to the window had thrown the magazine onto the veranda. After a thorough search Mr Mensah nearly gave up. It was, perhaps, an exercise book he had seen and not a magazine. However, his long years of teaching experience suggested to him that the boys could have thrown the magazine outside. When he looked through the window, lo and behold, there lay the magazine! He retrieved it, flipped through it and saw that it was full of obscenities. Mr Mensah fumed.");

Aboagye had specifically invited only the three elders but over three hundred people had come to the ceremony without any invitation.\n\u201CThe ceremony will start at 5:30 a.m.”, Aboagye told everyone who passed his shop the previous day. They in turn went and told others and at 5 a.m., when the ceremony was about to begin, there were about seventy people already in the house.\n \u201CWill you bring chairs from the rooms?” Aboagye requested the young ones among the guests. They entered every room in the house and brought out chairs and benches of all shapes and sizes. They were placed in a circle with the three elders sitting in the centre. \u201CWhere is the child? The ceremony should be completed before the sun rises”. One of them said.\nThe mother soon brought the two-week old baby. Twelve calabashes scrubbed the previous day were brought. They looked white and dry. The old man took one and poured some of the gin into it. He raised the head of the child and dipped his finger into the gin. He turned and asked the second elder sitting next to him, \u201CHave you got the name?” \u201CAgyepong, alias Koo Kra” .");
