We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

Rain, rain, go away \nBut they stopped abruptly when they looked up and saw dark clouds racing across the sky. These were signs of rain and the children were beside themselves with joy. Then they burst into yet another song:\nThe rains will soon come. The sky will be bright And the guns will boom\nAs they sang and danced, they were soon joined by their parents in their happiness. It was six months since it had last rained and all that time the farmers prayed for rain that would not come. The result was famine in the country for the land became so dry that new crops could not be sown and cassava could not be uprooted. The streams and the wells had also dried up and the people could find very little water for themselves and their livestock. Was it then strange that adults danced and sang like children in the hope that their troubles would soon be over? They were sure that the fetish priest‟s sacrifices would not be in vain.\nBut they woke up the next morning to find that the land was still dry; there was not a drop of rainwater anywhere.Then they became angry and ran after the fetish priest. But he was gone before they could lynch him.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nTeacher Amu never lost the opportunity to give pep-talks to his students. „Variety is the spice of life,‟ he often began. Then he would tell them how life has opposites, like good and bad. He would talk about the variety of birds, the different kinds of fish and species of trees. His students could always tell when teacher Amu‟s sermons were about to end. He would raise his voice and loop up as he made his point: “God made them all and He said, „It is good‟.”\nThese words had a lasting effect on his students. When the class was over, they would go on reeling with laughter as they recited these words. Soon, it was not surprising when they began to call Teacher Amu, „God made them all‟ whenever his back was turned.\nBut one of them, Kofi Abre, did not consider Teacher Amu‟s pep-talks funny at all. He was not amused that his classmates joked with his teacher‟s words. Teacher Amu had said that the world was made up of different things, different people and different habits. So why did they bother when he, Abre, acted differently?\nThe other day, he shouted down a school mate who called him lazy. He almost bloodied a friend‟s nose too when this friend scolded him for not doing his homework. Teacher Amu warned that he would punish Abre. It was an act of indiscipline. Kofi Abre shook his head. It was his friend who offended him yet Teacher Amu would punish him for being violent and different.")
