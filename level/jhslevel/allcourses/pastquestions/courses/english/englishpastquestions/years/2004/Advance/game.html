We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

Tortoise\u2019s body rattled in his empty shell as he walked. One day as he thought of a way to get food, his throat began to itch.He would go to the next village where he had heard there was still some food. He would steal some for himself and his family. He took the bush path and arrived at the village after sunset.\n The people were preparing their meals and the smell made his mouth water. How would he get this food? Not far away from him was the village playground where there was a big hollow log leaning against a tree. This log was the drum used to summon the villagers for very important announcements. When he reached the tree he decided to climb it so that he could see the village better.\n Unfortunately, as he was climbing, he fell because he was very weak and hungry. His shell hit the drum, sending out a loud kpom! kpom! noise.When they heard this noise, the villagers ran to the playground, believing they had been called, thereby leaving the food cooking in their homes.Very quickly Tortoise disappeared into a nearby bush and ran to the village. He filled his empty shell with as much of the food as he could carry and returned home.");

    alert("Passage II\n\nIn the centre of the town, the town clock chimed two o\u2019clock. In an abandoned house on the outskirts of the town an owl hooted as if to signal to Sergeant Abora and Constable Abaidoo to wake up from slumber. They had patrolled the town for hours and were heavy with sleep. The night was very dark and so cold that in spite of his thick overcoat, the Sergeant\u2019s teeth were chattering. He was about to speak when he heard a faint sound down the road that led to the town. Abaidoo also picked the sound. Both listened attentively and realized that a late traveller was coming up the road. They took cover behind two opposing trees. As he reached where Abaidoo was hiding, the traveller stumbled over what looked like the root of a tree.\nThen Constable Abaidoo quickly flashed his torchlight and bawled out, Stop or I shoot!\u2019 Abora\u2019s gun was also held in readiness. The traveller who carried a heavy load on his left shoulder panicked, dropping his cutlass in the process.\nWho are you? Where are you from? What\u2019s in your bag? Speak out or I shoot! We\u2019ve got you at last!\u2019 Abora exclaimed. Trembling with fear and stammering for words the traveller gave his name as Nsiah. He was returning from Fosa with a bag of plantain and cassava.\n But his cutlass and bag, both dripping with blood, gave him away. After a search the police found a human head and triumphantly marched him to the police station.")
