    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>

    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

                <p>(a) An account ofthe story of the prodigal son<br /><br />
From Luke15:11-32<br />
– There was a man who had two sons.<br />
– One day, the younger son asked his father to divide his property and give him his share immediately.<br />
– The father did as the sonrequested.<br />
– A few days after, the son gathered his entire share that the father gave to him and travelled into a far country.<br />
– While there, he lived a careless and extravagant lifestyle.<br />
– Aftersometime, hehadspent and wastedallthat hehad and was left withnothing.<br />
– There was also a famine(shortage of food and other basic necessities) in that country.<br />
– He ended up working for someone who made him take care of pigs.<br />
– At times, he was so hungry that he felt like feeding himself with the pigs‟ food.<br />
– None of his friends helped him or gave him anything.<br />
– Then, he remembered his father‟s house, where even servants had more than enough food
to eat; and here he was, almost starving to death.<br />
– He decided there and then to humble himself, go back to his father, plead for mercy and forgiveness and ask to work as a servant in his father‟s house.<br />
– So headed back to his father‟s house as he had planned.<br />
– On his way back home, his father saw him while he was still far away.<br />
– Out of compassion, he ran to meet him and welcomed him by hugging and kissing him.<br />
– The son confessed his sins and showed regret and repentance.<br />
– The father forgavehim and askedforhimto be clothed with the best robe,a ring and shoes.<br />
– The father also asked for the best calf to be killed and used fora feast to celebrate the return ofhis prodigal younger son.<br />
– Meanwhile, the older son, however,was not happy when hecame from work and heard
what was going on.<br />
– The reason he gave was that he has stayed faithful, loyal and obedient to the father all this while. Yet, the father had never thrown even a small party for him.<br />
– The father explained that all that he has belongs to him(the elderson), thereforeheshould
not worry. As for the prodigal son, he was considered lost and dead, but now he is found and alive<br /><br /><br />

(b) Lessons that can be learnt from the story<br />
(i) Wemustbepatient and waitforthe right time forcertain privileges<br />
(ii) God hasgiven us the free will to choose to be with him or be on our own, however, each choice has its consequences.<br />
(iii) Staying with God brings blessings and peace, where as moving away from God brings curses and suffering.<br />
(iv) We must avoid making hasty decisions<br />
(v) Wrongdoing / sin leads to shame and disgrace, while upright living leads to honour and grace.<br />
(vi) Whatever we are doing now has future implications, which are either positive or negative<br />
(vii) We must use our resources (money, time, energy,etc) forthings that wouldbenefit us
in future, rather than justspending/ wasting it.<br />
(viii)The friends who may influence one to waste his resources now, will leave/ even mock
(laugh at) the one when the resources are gone in future.<br />
(ix) We must not be in a hurry to leave home /be independent (from our parents/guardians).
Many times dependence is better and safer for us.<br />
(x) When we realize that we have done wrong/ made a mistake, we must humble ourselves, go and ask for forgiveness and change for the better.<br />
(xi) It is never too late to change our minds /repent.<br />
(xii) God is (and most parents/guardians/teachers are) ever willing to forgive and receive us back, whenever we go wrong, but repent and come back.<br />
(xiii)We must also be willing and ready to forgive anyone who offends us, even before the person apologizes.<br />
(xiv)God is merciful and gracious; so must we, his children.

               (a) African traditional stories on creation<br /><br />

Boshongo, Bantu Tribe(Central and SouthernAfrica)<br />
In the beginning there was only darkness, water, and the great god Bumba.One day Bumba,
in pain from a stomach ache, vomited up thesun. The sun dried up someofthe water, leaving land. Still in pain, Bumbavomited up the moon, thestars, and then some animals: the
leopard, the crocodile, the turtle, and, finally, some men, one of whom, Yoko Lima was white
like Bumba.<br /><br />

Dogon (Mali)<br />
At the beginning of time, Amma(a supreme god who lived in the celestial regions and was the origin of all creation)created the Earth and immediately joined with it.But the Earth’s clitoris opposed the male penis. Amma destroyed it, circumcising his wife, and they had a child, Ogo, and the twins, the Nommo. Ogo had no partner and was barren, so he introduced disorder into the world by committing incest with his mother, Earth.The first menstrual blood came from this union, as well as Yeban and Andumbulu, the spirits of the underworld. Amma created the stars by throwing pellets of earth into space. He created the sun and moon by modelling two white earthenware bowls, one encircled with red copper,the other with white copper.Black people were born under the sun and white people under the moon.<br /><br />

Efik (Central Nigeria):<br />
The creator, Abassi, created two humans and then decided to not allow them to live on earth. His wife, Atai, persuaded him to let them do so.In order to control the humans, Abassi insisted that they eat all their meals with him,thereby keeping them from growing or hunting food.Healsoforbadethemto procreate. Soon, though, the woman began growing food in the earth,and they stopped showing up to eat with Abassi. Then the man joined his wife in the fields,and before long there were children also. Abassi blamed his wife for the way things had turned out, but she told him she would handle it. She sent to earth death and discord to keep the people in their place.<br /><br />

Ekoi (South Nigeria):<br />
In the beginning there were two gods, Obassi Osaw and Obassi Nsi.The two gods created everything together. Then Obassi Osaw decided to live in the sky and Obassi Nsi decided to live on the earth. The god in the sky gives light and moisture, but also brings drought and storms.The god of the earth nurtures, and takes the people back to him when they die.One day long ago Obassi Osaw made a man and a woman, and placed them upon the earth.They knew nothing so Obassi Nsi taught them about planting and hunting to get food.<br /><br />

Ethiopia:<br />
Wak was the creator god who lived in the clouds. He kept the vault of the heavens at a distance from the earth and covered it with stars. He was a benefactor and did not punish. When the earth was flat Wak asked man to make his own coffin, and when man did this Wak shut him up in it and pushed it into the ground. For seven year she made fire rain down and the mountains were formed. Then Wak unearthed the coffin and man sprang forth, alive. Man tired of living alone,so Wak took some of his blood, and after four days,the blood became a woman whom the man married.They had 30 children,but the man was ashamed of having so<br /><br />

many so he hid 15 of them. Wak then made those hidden children into animals and demons.<br />

Wahungwe (Zimbabwe):<br />
Maori created the first man, Mwuetsi, who became the moon. Maori gave him a ngona horn filled with ngona oil and told him he would live at the bottom of the waters. Mwuetsi objected and said he wished to live on the land. Maori reluctantly agreed, but said Mwuetsi would give up immortality if he did.After a while Mwuetsi complained of loneliness,so Maori sent him a woman, Massassi (the morning star), to keep him company for two years. Each night they slept on opposite sides of a camp fire, until one night Mwuetsi jumped over theflameandtouched Massassi with a finger he had moistened with then gona oil. In the moning Massassi was huge, and soon gave birth to plants and trees until the whole earth was covered by them.At the end of two years Maori took Massassi away. Mwuetsi wept for eight years,at which time Maori sent him another woman, Morongo(the evening star), saying that she could stay for two years.On the first night Mwuetsi touched her with his oiled finger,but she said she was different than Massassi, and that they would have to oil their loins and have intercourse. This they did,this night,and every night there after. Every morning Morongo gave birth to the animals of creation.Then she gave birth to human boys and girls, who became full-grown by that very same evening. Maori voiced his disleasure with a fierce storm, and told Mwuetsi he was hastening his death with all this procreation. Morongo, ever the temptress, instructed Mwuetsi to build a door to their habitat so that Maori could not see what they were doing.He did this, and a gain they slept together.Now in the morning Morongo gave birth to violent animals; snakes, scorpions, lions, etc.One night Morongo told Mwuetsi to have intercourse with his daughters, which he did, thereby fathering the human race.<br /><br />

(b) How AIDS can be prevented in the community<br />

(ii) Intensifying public education on prevention and control of AIDS.<br /><br />

(iii) Undergoing Voluntary Counseling and Testing(VCT)– This is a test conducted to test for the presence of theHIV / AIDS virus in a person. The person is counseled before and after the test.<br /><br />

(iv) Being faithful to ones’ partner– Married couples must have sexual intimacy only with each other.In the case where one partner is already infected, then they must always use a condom in order to greatly reduce the risk of infecting the other partner.<br /><br />

(v) Using a condom when having sex with an infected person. For people who indulge in pre-marital / casual / extra-marital sex, it is advisable to use a condom in order to reduce the risk of getting infected.<br /><br />

(vi) Disinfection and sterilization of tools and equipment that are used on or in the body.
This must be done to kill any bacteria and viruses that maybe present, and hence prevent infection.<br /><br />

(vii) Avoiding the sharing of unsterilized cutting or piercing objects, such as syringes, needles, blades<br /><br />

(viii) Using anti retroviral drugs to help prevent HIV transmission from pregnant HIV- positive mother to unborn child. The drug helps to stop the multiplication and spread ofthe HIV, therefore reducing the risk ofthe expectant mother infecting the unborn child.
