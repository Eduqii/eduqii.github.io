<h3>Section A</h3>1.(a)In an experiment, four nails 1, 2, 3 and 4 are fixed with candle wax onto a metal bar and one end of the bar is heated by means of boiling water as shown in the diagram below<br /><br />
<span style="clear: both;"><img src="img/boilingWater.jpg"></span><br />
A, B, C, D are thermometers inserted in holes along the bar to measure the temperatures at the various points.<br/ ><br />

<p class = "questions">(i) What is the temperature of the boiling water?</p>

<u>Suggested Answer</u><br /><br />

1. (a) (i) Temperature = 100&deg;C or 212&deg;F or 373K<br /><br />

(ii) Observations (Nails)

Nails 1, 2, 3 and 4 will drop off one after the other
- Nail 1 drops first, nail 2 second, nail 3 third and nail 4 fourth<br /><br />

(iii) Observations(Thermometers)
The readings of Thermometers A,B, C and D will increase progressively till they reach 100&deg; C
-Thermometer A reaches 100&deg; C first, B second,C third and D fourth<br /><br />

(iv) Mode of heat transfer - Conduction<br /><br/>

(v) Effects of heat<br />

1. Causes increase in temperature(as shown by the thermometer readings)<br />

2. Causes change in state (candle wax melts - changes from solid to liquid)<br /><br />

(vi) Aim of experiment<br />

1. To show that metals are good conductors of heat<br/ >

2. To show that heat travels through metals
