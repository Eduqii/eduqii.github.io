question: 'PASSAGE II' + '<br />' + '<br />' +

'<i>' + 'There are two questions that people often ask about laughter. These are: what makes people laugh, and what laughter does to them.' +
'When you try to think of what makes people laugh or what they consider funny you start thinking about how one person behaves towards another in different situations. For example, why do people laugh when they see others behaving awkwardly, or see some kind of weakness in other person?' + 
'The explanation is often quite simple. We laugh when we see people behaving or acting in an odd manner. For example, if on your way to work or to school you see a big fat man in a leafy green suit, wearing a tiny straw hat, or at a party, you encounter a very short man dancing with a big tall woman, you will naturally laugh, won\u2019t you? These things are funny and queer.' +
'Apart from the strange things that make people laugh, laughter is good for our body and health. It is good for our lungs and allows us to release extra energy. It also has a great social value. If you enjoy laughter you invite good company. Indeed, in most societies, laughter is used as a way of keeping people who do not do the right things in check. Thus laughter is a way of ensuring discipline.' + '</i>' + '<br />' + '<br />' +
