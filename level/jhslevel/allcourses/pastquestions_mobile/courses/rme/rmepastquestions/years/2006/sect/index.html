    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three equal-width columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>. On mobile devices, tablets and below, the columns will automatically stack.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mixed: mobile and desktop</h2>
    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

               (a) The mode of prayer in Islam.<br /><br />

Introduction:<br /><br />
The ablution (wuzu) must be performed before every salat<br /><br />
Theprayer session comprises a number of movements / positions.<br /><br />
Each movement is always preceded bythe phrase„AllahuAkbar‟(God is Great).<br />

prayer, theysay’AllahuAkbar’meaning God is great, raisingthe hands to the ears or shoulder.<br /><br />

A short supplication glorifyingGodand seeking His protection is read.<br /><br />

Qiraat (Recitation fromQuran)<br />
Muslims recite Surah Al Fatiha, which is thefirst chapterin theQur’an. Verses from any another chapterarethenrecited.<br /><br />

Ruku (Bowingposition)<br />
The Muslim bows down, putting the hands on theknees and says’ glory be to God, the Most
Great’, threetimes.<br /><br />

Qiyaam (Standingposition)<br />
Whilemovinginto the upright position, Muslimsrecite’God listens to theonewho praises Him’and whilein thestandingposition, ‘To Godbelongs all praise’then isrecited.’God is Great’is recited again. Hands arelooselyat thesides this time.<br /><br />

Sujud (Prostrating position)<br /><br />

Sujud means to prostrate.Whilein theprostration position ‘Glory be to God, the Most High’ is repeated three times. Palms, knees, toes, forehead and nose must be the only body parts touching the ground.<br /><br />

Qa’da-i-Akhira (Sitting position)<br />
‘God is Great’is recitedwhile movingto thesittingposition. Muslims pausehere forafew seconds, either stayingsilent, or recitingashorterprayer.’God is Great’is recited oncemore as the sujud position is taken again.<br /><br />

Sujud (Prostrating position)<br />
This sujud is the same as the first one.
After reciting ‘Glory be to God, the MostHigh’, one’raka’ah’, or unitis complete.<br /><br />

Tashahhud<br />
After saying God is Great, Muslims return to the sitting position. They recite a set number of short prayers in Arabic, praisingGod,and sending peaceon the Prophet. They repeat the declaration of faith, raising the forefinger of their right hand, in order to act as a witness.<br /><br />

They then ask God to bestow blessings andpeaceupon Prophet Abrahamand his family, and ask forthe same forProphet Muhammad. Finally,Muslims ask for forgiveness and mercy, and ask God to bless them and their children until theDayof Judgement.<br /><br />

Peace to the right<br />
To end the prayer, Muslims first turn their faceto the right saying ‘Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.’<br />

actions)<br /><br />

‘Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah’is repeated turning to the left side now.
(Muslims believe the Angel on the rightside records all good actions and thoughts, while the oneon the left records all bad actions.)<br /><br />
