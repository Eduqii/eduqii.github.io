We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

		alert("PASSAGE I\n\nThere stood an enormous tree in the centre of the town. Its big branches and dense foliage gave shelter in all weathers and so it had become a natural meeting place. Benches had been placed round the base of its huge trunk so that the elders of the town might sit in comfort and gossip or talk about serious affairs of the town. This particular morning, three old men were resting on one of the benches. They had chosen the side which overlooked the road entering the town. From there they could see the market, the lorry park and the main street.\nAs they watched, a large green bus drove into the lorry park. It was surrounded immediately by a jostling crowd. Those who wished to travel hurried forward and food sellers rushed from all sides struggling to sell their wares. In the general uproar which followed, new passengers tried to get into the bus, whilst those who had reached their destination tried to alight. Others who were not willing to risk losing their seats stood blocking the doorway or leaned out of the bus windows as they bargained with the food sellers.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nAs I stood by a street in Accra that late afternoon watching people rushing home from work, I felt very safe. My sense of security came from the fact that Ghanaians are generally a kind and hospitable people, particularly to strangers. Although I had just arrived from my village, I was a Ghanaian and in my own capital. I should not fear anything.\nJust then, I felt a firm grip on my arm from behind. I did not feel threatened; rather I was relieved. I thought an old schoolmate must have spotted me, James Cudjoe, and decided to play our old game on me. How welcome! The good old days are here again.\nI turned to look the fellow in the face but the more I turned to my left the faster he moved to my right as he tightened his grip on my wrist watch. Suddenly he let go of my arm and bolted. I saw him vanish into the thick crowd. Certainly, this was not how to welcome a friend. People of the city are surely very strange!\nTotally confused, I made my way towards the lorry park to leave for my brother‟s house. In the gathering darkness, I tried to find out what time it was. To my utter surprise, I discovered that my wrist watch was gone. The rascal had made away with it. It was hardly new or even expensive yet the rogue found it worth stealing.")
