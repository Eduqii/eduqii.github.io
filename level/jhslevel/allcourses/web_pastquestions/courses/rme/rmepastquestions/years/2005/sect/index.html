    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>
    <div class="row row-cols-md-3 mb-3">
      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>

    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">

    </p>

    <hr class="my-4">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mixed: mobile and desktop</h2>
    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

euphoria (feeling„high‟or excited)that certain drugs tend to cause<br /><br />
