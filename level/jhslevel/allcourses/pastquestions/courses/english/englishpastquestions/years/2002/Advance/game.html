We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

		alert("PASSAGE I\n\nAntobam\u2019s first day in senior secondary school was the day he would never forget. That morning he got up earlier than usual ready for his father to take him to the new school. With the help of his father\u2019s houseboy, his trunk and chop box were packed into his father\u2019s car. At exactly eleven o\u2019clock, the car sped off as Antobam happily waved goodbye to his brothers and sisters.\nAfter about one and a half hours\u2019 drive, they arrived at the school. Antobam beamed with smiles as the car pulled up in front of the administration block. Some huge boys rushed to the car shouting, \u201CHommo, welcome; hommo, welcome!” Antobam misunderstood this for a warm welcome, but he was soon proved wrong.From the list of newcomers displayed on the notice board, Antobam\u2019s father saw his son\u2019s name under House Two and wanted to take the luggage there. But one of the boys politely said, \u201CDaddy, stop. We have a tradition here.”\n Before he knew what was happening, two of the boys had lifted his trunk and chop box and put them on Antobam\u2019s head. He had never carried any load on his head before, but here he was with the arduous task of carrying two heavy boxes. Tears started flowing as his father looked on in disbelief. He later left the school very disturbed, wondering what was going to happen to his beloved son.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nEvery year, thousands of African school leavers from the rural areas rush to the urban areas to seek employment. Apart from leaving the countryside thinly populated, these youths cause overcrowding in the cities. They cannot get any house to live in so they are found sleeping in market places and on verandas.\nMost of our youths regard agriculture as a poor man\u2019s business. They prefer white-collar jobs to farming and forget that one can gain fame or wealth through agriculture. Most of these youths are greatly disappointed in the townships. Lack of jobs and money force them to join bad companies, break into houses at night or snatch people\u2019s bags at lorry parks or in the street during the day. They often wear dirty clothes and are seen in the streets trying to find something to eat.\nOne way of checking this movement is by setting up factories in the rural areas and establishing large farms where the school leavers can easily find work. Other ways are providing good means of transport and communication. Libraries, medical services and post offices are equally important amenities necessary in rural areas.\nThese facilities together with good drinking water and electricity will make these areas attractive enough for the youth to remain and help grow food and cash crops for the country. They can also produce raw materials for our industries.")
