We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

		alert("PASSAGE I\n\nA long time ago, the world was in total darkness. There was neither water nor fire. Men lived in this condition for a long time because King Eagle, who was the custodian of the sun, moon, stars, water and fire, had bullied them into accepting that situation.\nMeanwhile, Eagle had a charming daughter who had fallen in love with Crow – a handsome spotless white bird. As their friendship grew stronger, Crow got to know what Eagle was keeping away from men. On one of his visits, therefore, he secretly stole Eagle‟s hidden treasure that consisted of light, water and fire and flew away with it.\nAs soon as he got outside, he hanged the sun in the sky. Instantly, the whole world was brilliantly lit up. When the sun set, he fixed the moon and spread the stars around it. Then the darkness of the night began to lift. He was so thrilled by his achievement that he glided and swerved in a beautiful display in the sky. While he was doing this, the water fell to the ground and formed rivers, lakes and streams.\nHe still held fast unto the fire in his beak. Suddenly some strong and violent winds blew smoke from the fire over Crow‟s beautiful feathers. The smoke made the feathers jet-black leaving a band of white feathers around his neck.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nAs we were eagerly preparing for our special supper of roasted chicken, pepper sauce and fried yam, we heard another loud knock at the door. Papa opened the door to let in a fast-talking handsome stranger.\nAccording to him he was passing to the next village but there were no vehicles. Therefore he was stranded. \nMy parents with their customary generosity allowed him to stay the rest of the day with us. Soon after, supper was ready. We the younger children had to eat in the kitchen, whilst my parents and the others ate in the dining room.\nFrom where we were eating we could hear and see the adults. “Now, Mr Anang,” said my father, “you being the last to arrive will share the chicken,” “Very well said,” agreed Mr Anang. He began by cutting the head of the chicken, which he gave to Papa saying, “You are the head of the family, so you get the head.” To my mother, he said, “You are the next to the head; therefore, get the neck.” My elder brother, Yoofi, and sister Aba had wings because they were of age and would need wings to fly away from the family nest. The other two guests got the feet in order that they could walk to their destinations. Finally, he declared in a loud voice, “I, a poor wandering man, who must treat my kwashiorkor once and for all, will take the rest!” There was a long silence after this around the dining table.");
