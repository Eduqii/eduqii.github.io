    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>

    <hr class="my-4">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mixed: mobile and desktop</h2>
    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

          4. Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow<br /><br />

          <p>When Pozo adopted Abate and Ali, he vowed to take great care of them. And he did his best. But Abate and Ali did exactly as they were told not to. Their greatest passion was snail-hunting.<br />
          As he left home for an important meeting one afternoon, Pozo told the boys that he would be particularly pleased if they did not join any snail-hunting group or go snail-hunting by themselves. He even promised surprise presents if they abstained from snail-hunting for once It was quite obvious to everyone that there would be snail-hunting as there had been a heavy downpour that morning.<br />
          Pozo’s meeting was a marathon. When he arrived home at 8:30 that night, neither of the boys was at home. He felt that something grave might have happened. He stood still for some time confused. He switched on his radio and tuned in to his favourite station, Hiawa FM and the breaking news was: “Five snail-hunters have been run over at Yaaboi by the early evening in-coming Densuano-bound train”. As the dreadful news hit him, Pozo winced.<br />
          Pozo was so stupefied that he did not notice Ali enter the house, sweating and breathless, carrying a head-load of snails But where was Abate?
          Furtively, the back door squeaked open. In stole the other boy, also sweating and breathless under the weight of the head-load of snails On seeing him, Pozo sighed, relieved. He shook his head. “These boys will surely be the death of me”, he murmured to himself. “When will they do exactly as they are told?”<br /><br />

          (a) (i) Why was Pozo taking care of the boys?<br />
              (ii) Why do you think Pozo did not want the boys to go snail-hunting?<br /><br />

          (b) State the two reasons why Pozo was sure that the boys would go snail-hunting.<br /><br />
          
          (c) What is the meaning of the sentence, “Pozo’s meeting was a marathon”?<br /><br />

          (d) (i) Why was Pozo so worried when he returned from the meeting?<br />
              (ii) How did the news of the rail accident affect Pozo?<br /><br />
          
          (e) Explain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:<br />
              (i) have been run over;<br />
              (ii) in stole the other boy;<br />
              (iii) be the death of me.<br /><br />

          (f) For each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same, and can fit into the passage:<br />
              (i) vowed;<br />
              (ii) passion;<br />
              (iii) abstained;<br />
