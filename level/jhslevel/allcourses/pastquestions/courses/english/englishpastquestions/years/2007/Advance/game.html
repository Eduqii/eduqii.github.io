We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

		alert("PASSAGE I\n“Help! Help! Fire!” This and other noises like the banging of doors and crunching footsteps woke Barimah up. “Something must be done,” he exclaimed to his wife Fosua who was already awake. He dressed up quickly, opened the door and went out advising his wife not to leave the house.It was pitch dark outside; the only light came from the flaming house of Agya Atta. By the time Barimah got there, the house was truly in flames and people had gathered around busily and frantically pouring water and sand on the flames. They were doing everything they could to put out the fire.\n Meanwhile, they had managed to rescue a few things from the fire. These Barimah caused to be packed and taken to his house to prevent them from being looted. He then took Agya Atta‟s wife and children to his house and quickly returned to fight the flames.Araba had won the hearts of many people by her good deeds and kindness. It was therefore sad to see her lose her property, as well as the house she and Agya Atta had toiled to build.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n Many smokers ignore the warning about the dangers of smoking although there is a national campaign against the habit. The United Nations has set aside a day to be observed against the killer habit.The story is told of a young man who became addicted to smoking. In no time, he developed smoking- related diseases and died miserably, leaving behind his wife and children in poverty.Research shows that the smoker is far more likely to suffer, if not die of major diseases like lung cancer and heart failure, than a non-smoker.It is generally known that smoking during pregnancy is undesirable. Women who smoke produce underweight babies. They are also likely to miscarry, have still-born babies or lose them after birth. If such children survive and attend school, they do not perform well.\nWhat is most annoying about smoking is the risk to passive smokers. Non-smokers breathing in smokefrom other people‟s cigarettes, pipes and cigars stand the risk of contracting the diseases that harm smokers.If smokers knew how non-smokers feel about them, they would give up the habit. The smoker is regarded by many as a social misfit – one who does not consider the welfare of others but his own interest in smoking, no matter where he.")
