    <h1>Bootstrap grid examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">Basic grid layouts to get you familiar with building within the Bootstrap grid system.</p>
    <p>In these examples the <code>.themed-grid-col</code> class is added to the columns to add some theming. This is not a class that is available in Bootstrap by default.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Five grid tiers</h2>
    <p>There are five tiers to the Bootstrap grid system, one for each range of devices we support. Each tier starts at a minimum viewport size and automatically applies to the larger devices unless overridden.</p>

    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-4 themed-grid-col">.col-4</div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three equal-width columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>. On mobile devices, tablets and below, the columns will automatically stack.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three equal columns alternative</h2>
    <p>By using the <code>.row-cols-*</code> classes, you can easily create a grid with equal columns.</p>
    <div class="row row-cols-md-3 mb-3">
      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>

      <div class="col themed-grid-col"><code>.col</code> child of <code>.row-cols-md-3</code></div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Three unequal columns</h2>
    <p>Get three columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong> of various widths. Remember, grid columns should add up to twelve for a single horizontal block. More than that, and columns start stacking no matter the viewport.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-3 themed-grid-col">.col-md-3</div>
      <div class="col-md-6 themed-grid-col">.col-md-6</div>
      <div class="col-md-3 themed-grid-col">.col-md-3</div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns</h2>
    <p>Get two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Full width, single column</h2>
    <p class="text-warning">
      No grid classes are necessary for full-width elements.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-4">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Two columns with two nested columns</h2>
    <p>Per the documentation, nesting is easy—just put a row of columns within an existing column. This gives you two columns <strong>starting at desktops and scaling to large desktops</strong>, with another two (equal widths) within the larger column.</p>
    <p>At mobile device sizes, tablets and down, these columns and their nested columns will stack.</p>
    <div class="row mb-3">
      <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col">

    <h2 class="mt-4">Mixed: mobile and desktop</h2>
    <p>The Bootstrap v4 grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (extra small, this class infix is not used), sm (small), md (medium), lg (large), and xl (extra large). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
    <p>Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for md, lg and xl, you only need to specify md.</p>

                    (a) Attributes of God from the Christian point of view<br />

                     Omnipotent,<br />
                     Omniscient,<br />
                     Omnipresent,<br />
                     All- Loving,<br />
                     Alpha and Omega,<br />
                     Dependable,<br />
                     Merciful / Gracious<br />
                     Creator<br />
                     Most holy/ righteous, etc<br /><br /><br />

                    (b) Ways Christians demonstrate the attributes of God in their lives<br />

                    (i) Omnipresent God means God is everywhere and can see everything.
                    Therefore Christians try to<br />
                    • do the right thing wherever they are, since God can see them.<br />
                    • speak the truth and be at right places all the time<br />
                    • be sincere to God especially concerning their sins and worries<br />
                    • communicate with Him (by prayer) wherever they find themselves.<br />
                    • avoid doing bad things like gossip, lies, stealing, etc<br /><br />

                    (ii) Merciful / Compassionate – This means God forgives us and gives us what we do not even deserve<br />
                    Christians therefore try to<br />
                    • be merciful to (forgive) others,<br />
                    • tolerate the negative behaviours of others.<br />
                    • be gracious to others – offer help to those who may not even deserve it.<br /><br />

                    (iii) Creator – This means God is the originator (maker) of everything.<br /> And He has given us the power to invent so many things out of His creation.<br />
                    Christians therefore try to<br /> 
                    • be innovative and creative<br />
                    • offer solutions to problems within their environment<br />
                    • preserve the things that God has created, such as rivers, trees, wildlife, etc.<br /><br />

                    (iv) Love – This means that God has strong affection for us and therefore does all things for us to live well.<br />
                    Christians therefore try to<br />
                    • love others, just as God has loved them<br />
                    • offer help to everyone, including even strangers<br />
                    • sacrifice their time, energy, possessions, etc, for the sake of others who might need them<br /><br />

                    (v) Most Holy / Righteous – This means that God has no sin in Him.
                    Christians therefore try to<br />
                    • be righteous in all ways – do the right things at the right time, in the right way and under the right circumstances.<br />
                    • avoid temptations or situations that can lead to temptations.<br /><br />

                    (vi) Protector – This means God shields us from danger.<br />
                    Christians therefore try to<br />
                    • protect the vulnerable in the society like the orphans, widows and the destitute.<br />
                    • defend the cause of the voiceless in society

                    (a) The five pillars of Islam<br />

                    (i) Kalimat Ush Shahadah<br />
                     This is the declaration that Allah is the only true God and Mohammed is His messenger.<br />
                    • It is the first Pillar of Islam.<br />
                    • One can only become and remain as a Muslim only by declaring this faith<br />
                    • It is repeated five times at the Islamic call to prayer<br />
                    • A Muslim declares this when he or she wakes up and before he or she sleeps<br />
                    • Shahadah allows a Muslim to declare to the whole world that there is only one God<br />
                    • it also makes a Muslim remain faithful to Allah<br /><br />

                    (ii) Salat<br />
                    • There are five daily prayers by Muslims. It is the second Pillar of Islam.<br />
                    • Before salat is done one must perform ablution ( the ritual cleansing of some parts of the body like the hand, feet, face, etc with water). Tayammum is performed in the absence of water especially in the desert with fine dust.<br />
                    • Salat consists of (Fajr-5:00am to 5:30am, Zuhr- 1:00pm to 1:30pm, Asr-3:00pm to 3:30pm, Magrib- 6:00pm to 6:30pm and Isha– 7:00pm to late night)<br />
                    • It follows prescribed procedure and times. For example the Muslim must face the East “Qibla” and follow regulated postures like standing, sitting and kneeling<br />
                    • Muslims can worship together in a mosque or as individuals anywhere. But it is believed that the prayers said at the mosques bring special blessings to them.<br />
                    • Salat allows a Muslim to get blessings from Allah<br />
                    • It also strengthens the spiritual bond between Allah and Muslims<br /><br />

                    (iii) Zakat-<br />
                    • This is the act of giving alms to the poor and needy like orphans, the sick, the aged, the disabled men and women.<br />
                    • It is the third Pillar of Islam.<br />
                    • A wealthy Muslim must give at least 2.5% of his /her wealth to the poor.<br />
                    • The items can be in cash or kind.<br />
                    • Allah demands from every Muslim to do good to people, especially the poor and needy.<br />
                    • It is believed by Muslims that it purifies the giver and drives away evil.<br />
                    • Zakat unites the rich and the poor<br />
                    • It reduces extreme poverty in the society<br />
                    • It also reduces crimes which usually results from poverty.<br /><br />

                    (iv) Saun-<br />
                    • This is fasting in the month of Ramadan for a period of about thirty (30) days.<br />
                    • It is the fourth Pillar of Islam<br />
                    • The Muslim must wake up early at dawn and take meals before sunrise and break the fast at 6:00 pm.<br />
                    • Pregnant women, babies, menstruating women, travelers and very old people etc are exempted from this. Menstruating women must do it when their period ends.<br />
                    • A Muslim during this period must refrain from some acts such as sex, fights, etc.<br />
                    • It makes them calm and sober<br />
                    • It also draws them to Allah<br /><br />

                    (v) Hajj-<br />
                    • This is the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.<br />
                    • It is fifth Pillar of Islam.<br />
                    • A Muslim is to embark on this journey at least once in a life time.<br />
                    • At Mecca, the Muslim performs some ritual like going round the Ka’aba seven times and throwing stones.<br />
                    • It increases a Muslim’s faith in Allah.<br />
                    • It also brings special blessings from Allah.<br /><br /><br />

                    (b) Reasons why Muslims worship<br />

                    (i) Islamic worship draws them to Allah<br />
                    (ii) It paves way for Muslims to receive Allah’s blessings<br />
                    (iii) It leads them to Heaven.<br />
                    (iv) It makes Muslims live righteous lives<br />
