    <h4>Answer Question 1 in Section A and any other three questions in Section B.<em> Credit will be given for clarity of expression and orderly presentation of material</em></h4>
    <h3>Section A</h3><b>1.</b>(a)In an experiment, the surfaces of three iron nails were cleaned dry and placed in three separate test tubes A, B and C as shown in the diagram.<br />Study the diagram carefully and answer the questions that follow<br />
	<span style="clear: both;"><img src="img/tubes.png"></span><br />
	After three days the nail in test tube A was found to have rusted while the nail in test tubes B and C did not rust.<br/ ><br />

    <p>(i)Suggest and aim for the experiment.</p>
    <p>(ii) Why was the water in test tube B boiled?</p>
    <p>(iii) State the function of the oil on top of the water in test tube B.</p>
    <p class = "questions">(iv) What is the purpose of the calcium chloride in test tube C?</p>
    <p class="questions">(v) Why did the nail in Test A rust?</p>
    <p class="questions">(vi) Why did the nail in test tube<br />
	(&alpha;)B did not rust?<br />
	(&beta;)C did not rust?</p>
	<p>(vii) From the experiment, explain why oil is applied on the surface of a metal to prevent rusting.</p>
	[10 marks]<br /><br />
      <p>(b) In an experiment, the following activities were carried out on two green leaves A and B. Leaf A was taken from a plant placed in the sunlight for some time while leaf V was taken from a plant placed in a dark cupboard for 24 hours.</p>
	<p>Activity.<br />
	I.Leaves dipped in boiling water for 1 minute<br />
	II. Leaves dipped in warm alcohol<br />
	III. Leaves washed in cold water<br />
	IV. Leaves dipped in iodine solution</p>
      <p>After dipping in the iodine solution, it was observed that leaf A changed colour. Study the activities carefully and answer the questions that follow.<br />
	  (i) Suggest an aim for the experiment.</p>

      <p>(ii) Explain briefly why each of the following activities were carried out:<br />
	  (&alpha;)I<br />
	  (&beta;)II<br />
	  (&gamma;)III</p>

      <p>(iii) State the colour change of leaf A.</p>
	  <p>(iv) Explain why leaf A changed colour?</p>
	  <p>(v) Why is it necessary to de-starch the plant before starting the experiment?</p>
	  <p>(vi)From the above experiment, what conclusions(s) can be drawn.</p><br />
	  <p>(c) You are provided with two dry soil samples A and B, a measuring cylinder, beakers, funnels, filter paper, beam balance, stop watch and water.
With the aid of a labelled diagram, describe an experiment to find out which of the two soil samples can hold more water.</p>
<p>(d) The diagram below is an illustration of an experiment that was carried out. In the experiment three pins 1, 2 and 3 were fixed with candle wax onto a metal bar and one end of the bar was heated by means of boiling water. A, B and C are the thermometers inserted in holes along the bar to measure the temperatures at the various points.</p>
<p>Study the diagram carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p>
<span style="clear: both;"><img src="img/boilingWater.jpg"></span><br />
<p>(i) Suggest an aim for the experiment? <br />
(ii) What is the temperature of the boiling water?<br />
(iii) State the observations that would be made about the pins 1, 2 and 3.<br />
(iv) State the observations that would be made about the temperatures<br />
Recorded by the thermometers A, B and C.<br />
(v) State how heat from the sun is transmitted to the earth.</p>
