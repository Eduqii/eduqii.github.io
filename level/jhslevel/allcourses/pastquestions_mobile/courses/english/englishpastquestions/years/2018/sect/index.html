          4. Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow<br /><br />

          <p>When Pozo adopted Abate and Ali, he vowed to take great care of them. And he did his best. But Abate and Ali did exactly as they were told not to. Their greatest passion was snail-hunting.<br />
          As he left home for an important meeting one afternoon, Pozo told the boys that he would be particularly pleased if they did not join any snail-hunting group or go snail-hunting by themselves. He even promised surprise presents if they abstained from snail-hunting for once It was quite obvious to everyone that there would be snail-hunting as there had been a heavy downpour that morning.<br />
          Pozo’s meeting was a marathon. When he arrived home at 8:30 that night, neither of the boys was at home. He felt that something grave might have happened. He stood still for some time confused. He switched on his radio and tuned in to his favourite station, Hiawa FM and the breaking news was: \u201CFive snail-hunters have been run over at Yaaboi by the early evening in-coming Densuano-bound train”. As the dreadful news hit him, Pozo winced.<br />
          Pozo was so stupefied that he did not notice Ali enter the house, sweating and breathless, carrying a head-load of snails But where was Abate?
          Furtively, the back door squeaked open. In stole the other boy, also sweating and breathless under the weight of the head-load of snails On seeing him, Pozo sighed, relieved. He shook his head. \u201CThese boys will surely be the death of me”, he murmured to himself. \u201CWhen will they do exactly as they are told?”<br /><br />

          (a) (i) Why was Pozo taking care of the boys?<br />
              (ii) Why do you think Pozo did not want the boys to go snail-hunting?<br /><br />

          (b) State the two reasons why Pozo was sure that the boys would go snail-hunting.<br /><br />
          
          (c) What is the meaning of the sentence, \u201CPozo’s meeting was a marathon”?<br /><br />

          (d) (i) Why was Pozo so worried when he returned from the meeting?<br />
              (ii) How did the news of the rail accident affect Pozo?<br /><br />
          
          (e) Explain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:<br />
              (i) have been run over;<br />
              (ii) in stole the other boy;<br />
              (iii) be the death of me.<br /><br />

          (f) For each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same, and can fit into the passage:<br />
              (i) vowed;<br />
              (ii) passion;<br />
              (iii) abstained;<br />

                Scribbler,<br />
                The dream in your mind fills the shelf.<br />
                When upon the shelf you gaze,<br />
                5 vacuum stares at you.<br />
                There is your quill and parchment<br />
                but heavy are your hands.<br />
                Why?<br />
                Because disuse numbs the wrist.<br /><br />

                (h) What does "Scribbler” refer to?<br />
                (i) What does "The dream in your mind” refer to?
