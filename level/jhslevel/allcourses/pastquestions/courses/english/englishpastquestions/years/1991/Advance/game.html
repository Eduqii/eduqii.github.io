We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

    alert("PASSAGE I\n\nWhen Mr Appiah looked at the two happy faces of his nephews, he forgot about his aching feet and smiled. He had spent the whole day showing Asare and Attah, who came from the village, around Accra. He was satisfied that they were happy. It was not until they were seated on a bench in the public garden that he realized how hot, tired and dusty he was.\nIt was a long time since he had walked so much. Like many other successful men, Mr Appiah had acquired the habit of going everywhere in his car, so that day‟s sight-seeing expedition had worn him out.\n„Well, what do you think of Accra?‟ He asked the boys.\n„Oh!‟ exclaimed Attah. „it‟s a wonderful place!‟„I didn‟t imagine any place could be like this, Uncle‟ said Asare, „Everything is so splendid. The roads are very wide and the buildings magnificent‟.\n„Boys, don‟t get the wrong impression. Today you‟ve seen the best parts of our city, but there are bad areas with buildings falling apart, narrow streets and insanitary conditions. However, these buildings are being demolished, said Mr. Appiah.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nThe Akosombo Dam and the great Volta Lake are famous over the world. The two main reasons for building the dam were, to generate electricity and to use the electricity for the production of aluminium from bauxite.\nAluminium is used throughout the world; so both the production of electricity and the production of aluminium are of great value to Ghana.\nIt may seem strange to talk about producing electricity by building a dam, but in fact a lot of dams have been built all over the world for this purpose. What happens is that a concrete wall, called a dam, is constructed across a river at a narrow point. A large lake then develops behind the wall. Tunnels are made in the dam so that water from the lake can rush fiercely through them. This powerful flow of water is used to drive huge machines called turbines, to generate electricity. All that the engineers need is the water rushing down from the lake, and all this costs them nothing! But of course the building of the dam and the fixing of the machines cost a great deal of money.\nBig dams have been built in many parts of the world. The Akosombo Dam is one of the biggest. However, the lake, which has been formed, is in fact the biggest man-made lake in the world.")
