    <h3>Section A</h3><b>1.</b>(a)In an experiment, four nails 1, 2, 3 and 4 are fixed with candle wax onto a metal bar and one end of the bar is heated by means of boiling water as shown in the diagram below<br /><br />
	<span style="clear: both;"><img src="img/boilingWater.jpg"></span><br />
	A, B, C, D are thermometers inserted in holes along the bar to measure the temperatures at the various points.<br/ ><br />

    <p>(i) What is the temperature of the boiling water?</p>
    <p>(ii) State the observations that will be made about nails 1, 2, 3 and 4</p>
    <p>(iii) State the observations that will be made about the temperatures recorded by thermometers A, B, C and D.</p>
    <p class = "questions">(iv) What mode of heat transfer is demonstrated in the experiment </p>
    <p class="questions">(v) State one effect of heat that is associated with the experiment</p>
    <p class="questions">(vi) State the aim of the experiment</p>
	[10 marks]<br /><br />
      <p>(b) In an experiment, a student took three iron nails and cleaned their surfaces dry and placed them in three separate test tubes in set-ups A, B and C as shown in the diagram.</p>
	<span style="clear: both;"><img src="img/nailExperiment.jpg"></span><br />
      <p>After three days the nail in set-up A was found to have rusted while the nails in set-ups B and C did not.<br />

<p>Activity<br />

I. Leaves dipped in boiling water for 1 minute<br />

II. Leaves dipped in warm alcohol<br />

III. Leaves washed in cold water<br />

IV. Leaves dipped into iodine solution</p>
<p>After dipping in the iodine solution, it was observed that leaf A changed colour while leaf B did not change colour.

Answer the following questions:</p>
<p>(i) Explain why each of the activities I,II,III and IV was carried out. <br />
(ii) Statethe colour change of leaf A<br />
(iii) Explain why leaf A changed colour but leaf B did not.<br />
(iv) Suggest an aim for the experiment. [10 marks]
