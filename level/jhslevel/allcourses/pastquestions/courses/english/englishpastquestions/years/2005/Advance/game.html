We were suddenly awakened at dawn by the screams of the tenants in our house. They were making a lot of commotion in the yard.<br />
Daddy quickly jumped from his bed and made for the door. Not long after, we heard him scream. We ran to the hall, switched on the
lights and saw him lying flat on his back holding his forehead.<br />
In his haste to get to the hall door, he must have forgotten to switch on the lights thus running straight and crashing his head
into the pillar in the middle of the hall. When we examined his forehead, we saw a big lump and blood oozing from a deep cut near
his eyebrow.<br />

Mummy, a retired nursing sister, shouted instructions to me to get the first-aid box, some ice cubes and Daddy’s towel. When the
items were brought, she set to work first on the cut. She put some ice cubes in the towel and pressed the towel on the cut for
about two minutes. She then wiped the blood gently.<br />
Afterwards, she put a little iodine on a piece of gauze, placed it on the cut and bandaged it. Turning to the lump, she massaged
it with some ice cubes, which reduced the swelling.<br />
She then opened the front door and we beheld a pathetic scene. Lying in the middle of the house was the motionless body of one
of the tenants. Trying to resist an attack from the armed robbers, he had been butchered mercilessly and his body left in the middle
of the house.

Today, Ayele is not talking, though Esinam expects her to say something about her new bag. “So is that how you are? You‟re not passing any comment about my schoolbag? Dad gave it to me when he returned from America yesterday.” Ayele‟s reply is a mere grunt, but Esinam is in no mood to be unhappy. Ignoring her friend‟s mood, she breaks into a song about her parents‟ many acts of love. „Mum and Dad buy me dresses, shoes and anything I wish for, if I ask. \nIt’s great to be young!‟\nAyele is strapping on her back an old school bag once used by her elder sister. The brown colour has faded because she washes it too many times. When she breaks her silence she speaks solemnly and without regret. “I‟ve grown used to the old dresses, bags and shoes Mum buys. \nShe says she can‟t do more. I trust and love her.” There is a tremble in her voice, as though she is about to cry. But her eyes gradually brighten up as she speaks on: „I‟m in JSS 3, like you, and we are both doing well. It‟s great to look to the future with hope.‟ Esinam nods her agreement as the school bell rings and breaks their walk into a gallop.");

    alert("PASSAGE II\n\nThere are two questions that people often ask about laughter. These are: what makes people laugh, and what laughter does to them.\nWhen you try to think of what makes people laugh or what they consider funny you start thinking about how one person behaves towards another in different situations. For example, why do people laugh when they see others behaving awkwardly, or see some kind of weakness in other person?\nThe explanation is often quite simple. We laugh when we see people behaving or acting in an odd manner. For example, if on your way to work or to school you see a big fat man in a leafy green suit, wearing a tiny straw hat, or at a party, you encounter a very short man dancing with a big tall woman, you will naturally laugh, won‟t you? These things are funny and queer.\nApart from the strange things that make people laugh, laughter is good for our body and health. It is good for our lungs and allows us to release extra energy. It also has a great social value. If you enjoy laughter you invite good company. Indeed, in most societies, laughter is used as a way of keeping people who do not do the right things in check. Thus laughter is a way of ensuring discipline.")
